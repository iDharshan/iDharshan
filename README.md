# Hey, I'm Dharshan ðŸ‘‹  
Machine Learning Engineer (who builds stuff that *actually* works)

## So, what do I do?
- Build and deploy ML models that make sense (and predictions)
- Fine-tune LLMs using LoRA, PEFT â€” the good stuff, not the buzzwords
- RAG pipelines with LangChain + vector DBs that *actually* retrieve relevant info
- Wrap it all up with FastAPI, Docker, and a touch of âœ¨ sanity âœ¨

## Cool stuff I've worked on:
- Transformers from scratch â€” NumPy to PyTorch (yes, it worked)
- LSTM models for real-world problems (SRU optimization, aquaponics monitoring)
- RAG systems + LLM fine-tuning in freelance projects (and nobody cried)
- Currently building on Jetson Orin Nano for real-time scrap detection (fancy, I know)

## Tech I actually use:
`PyTorch` â€¢ `FastAPI` â€¢ `scikit-learn` â€¢ `NumPy` â€¢ `Pandas` â€¢ `LangChain`â€¢ `Azure`

> Still training models in 2025 that can't even overfit a toy dataset? Bold strategy.
